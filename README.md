# Facade

A Home Assistant add-on that brings a dweller ESP32 to life — a virtual pet with needs, personality, and AI-powered reactions to your smart home.

```

## How it works

- **Needs engine** — hunger, boredom, loneliness, and energy decay over time. Happiness is derived from how well the pet's needs are met. Feed, pet, and play with it via MQTT commands.
- **AI brain** — events are filtered through Claude Haiku (cheap, fast), then interesting ones are evaluated by Claude Sonnet with full home context + pet needs to pick the right face.
- **Personality** — configurable name and traits that shape how the brain picks expressions.
- **Quiet hours** — no face changes during sleep hours.
- **Rate limiting** — max face changes per hour prevents runaway API costs.
- **Persistence** — pet state survives reboots.
- **Idle moods** — if a need gets critical and nothing has happened for 30 min, the pet expresses it on its own.

## Home Assistant Entities

The add-on auto-creates entities via MQTT Discovery. No custom component needed.

### Sensors
| Entity | Description |

| `sensor.dweller_hunger` | Hunger level (0-100%) |
| `sensor.dweller_boredom` | Boredom level (0-100%) |
| `sensor.dweller_loneliness` | Loneliness level (0-100%) |
| `sensor.dweller_energy` | Energy level (0-100%) |
| `sensor.dweller_happiness` | Happiness level (0-100%) |
| `sensor.dweller_mood` | Current mood name |
| `sensor.dweller_mood_reason` | Why the mood changed |
| `sensor.dweller_dominant_need` | Most urgent need (or "none") |

### Buttons
| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `button.feed_buddy` | Feed the pet (-30 hunger) |
| `button.pet_buddy` | Pet it (-25 loneliness) |
| `button.play_buddy` | Play with it (-35 boredom) |

### Select
| Entity | Description |

| `select.dweller_mood_override` | Manually set a mood |

All entities are grouped under a single **Dweller** device in HA.

## Dashboard Card

A custom Lovelace card is included at [`dweller-card.js`](dweller-card.js).

### Install

1. Copy `dweller-card.js` to `/config/www/dweller-card.js` on your HA instance
2. Add as a resource: **Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources → Add** with URL `/local/dweller-card.js` (JavaScript Module)
3. Add to a dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:dweller-card
name: Buddy
entity_prefix: dweller
```

The card shows:
- Pet name and mood emoji
- Current mood with reason
- Alert banner when a need is critical
- Need bars (hunger, boredom, loneliness, energy, happiness) with color coding
- Feed / Pet / Play buttons

## Cost

- **Haiku filter**: ~100-300 calls/day × $0.001 = $0.10-0.30/day
- **Brain**: ~5-20 calls/day × $0.01-0.05 = $0.05-1.00/day
- **Total**: ~$5-40/month
